# Description 
This repository houses AI projects that I have completed.
I currently only have a sudoku solver up, but am in the process of moving my other AI projects to this repo.  Those project include a BFS, DFS and A* search in
which a square puzzle is solved.  For the square puzzle think of the phone app where pictures are scrambled and there is only one open space.  The goal being to 
recreate the picture properly.  The other project is a solver to the game 2048 and uses adversarial search to try to beat the random block being put down.  This
is also a common phone app game.
